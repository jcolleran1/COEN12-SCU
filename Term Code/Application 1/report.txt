Application 1 Big O run times worst case scenario:
destroydataSet(): O(1)
creatDataSet(): O(1)
searchAge(): O(n)
insertion(): O(1)
deletion(): O(n)
maxAgeGap(): O(1)

The reason that i chose to use an array of structs for application 1 is because the max number of students is already given and searching with an array is only O(n) so I figured this would be the most practicle and simple way of completing appliction 1. I could have lowered the Big O worst case scenary by using Hash table with chainging or a BST.
