Application 2 Big O run times worst case scenario:
destroydataSet(): O(1)
creatDataSet(): O(1)
searchId(): O(n)
insertion(): O(1)
deletion(): O(n)


The reason that i chose to use an array of structs for application 2 is simular to application_1 this is due to the fact that the max number of students is already given and searching with an array is only O(n) so I figured this would be the most practicle and simple way of completeing application_2 I could have lowered the Big O worst case scenary by using a Hash table.
